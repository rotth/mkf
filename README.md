# mkf
File creator written in C.

# Usage
$ ```mkf <file(s)>```  
## Example
$ ```mkf file1.txt file2.txt```  

# Why?
Usually when you want to create a file on Linux you use the GNU touch util which is an huge overkill for just creating a file (GNU touch does much more than this, it's over 400 lines long).  
When creating mkf I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.  
Mkf just creates a file(s) with the name(s) specified by user. That's it.
